## 🤔 Why This Exists

**Without configuration**, Claude Code starts every session with zero context about your project:

```
You: "Run the tests"
Claude: "What test framework do you use? What's the command?"

You: "Use our API client"
Claude: "I don't see an API client. Where is it located?"

You: "Follow our coding standards"
Claude: "What are your coding standards?"
```

**With claude-dotfiles**, Claude remembers everything:

```
You: "Run the tests"
Claude: *runs `pytest -v`*

You: "Use our API client"
Claude: *imports from src/lib/api.ts*

You: "Follow our coding standards"
Claude: *uses your error handling pattern, naming conventions, etc.*
```

**One-time setup. Permanent memory.**

## ⚡ Quick Start

**30 seconds to a smarter Claude:**

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/peopleforrester/claude-dotfiles.git ~/.claude-dotfiles
cd ~/.claude-dotfiles
./install.sh

# Copy a template to your project
cp templates/standard/CLAUDE.md ~/your-project/CLAUDE.md

# Edit it for your project
# Then start Claude Code - it now knows your project!
```

### Rules System

Rules are always-loaded constraints organized in a modular structure:

**Common rules** (apply to all projects):

| Rule | What It Enforces |
|------|------------------|
| **[security.md](./rules/common/security.md)** | OWASP Top 10, secrets management, input validation |
| **[coding-style.md](./rules/common/coding-style.md)** | Immutability, file organization, naming conventions |
| **[testing.md](./rules/common/testing.md)** | TDD workflow, 80% coverage minimum |
| **[git-workflow.md](./rules/common/git-workflow.md)** | Conventional commits, PR process |
| **[performance.md](./rules/common/performance.md)** | Model selection, context management |
| **[agents.md](./rules/common/agents.md)** | When to delegate to subagents |

**Language-specific rules** (in `rules/typescript/`, `rules/python/`, `rules/golang/`):
- `coding-style.md` — Language-specific conventions and idioms
- `testing.md` — Framework-specific test patterns
- `security.md` — Language-specific security practices
- `hooks.md` — Auto-formatting and linting hooks
- `patterns.md` — Common architectural patterns

## 🛡️ Permission Profiles

Control how much autonomy Claude has:

| Profile | Claude Can... | Best For |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Conservative** | Read files, ask before changes | Learning, sensitive projects |
| **Balanced** ⭐ | Edit files, ask before shell commands | Daily development |
| **Autonomous** | Most actions without asking | Trusted automation |

All profiles block access to `.env`, `~/.ssh/`, `~/.aws/`, and dangerous commands.

```bash
./install.sh --profile balanced  # Recommended
```
